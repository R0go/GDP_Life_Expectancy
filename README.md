# GDP_Life_Expectancy
This project aims at analyzing the relationship between country's GDP and the life expectancy of its citizens.

Project Goals (*) and analysis (-)
Explore the relationship between country's GDP and the life expectancy of its citizens. Explore the hypothesis: higher GDP is positively correlated with life expectancy in the given country

* Check trends over time and estimate the linear relationship between GDP and life expectancy
	- plot a line chart showing each country's GDP and life expectancy trend
	- estimate the linear correlation
	
* Compare countries' GDP and life expectancy
	- bar chart comparing countries' GDP
	- bar chart comparing countries' life expectancy
	- scatter plot (?) - GDP vs life expectancy (hue = country)
	
	
* Check whether GDP can predict life expectancy
	- ?? Estimate the % difference in GDP between countries and their related % difference in life expectancy (median difference?)
	- ?? estimate the differences for every year
	- plot mean GDP and mean LE from every country

Data:

Country
Year
GDP
LE

* check the completeness of the data
* check the format of the data
* check for any invalid values
* work out the GDP format
